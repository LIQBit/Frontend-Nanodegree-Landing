# Landing Page Project

This is a project for the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree course. The aims of this project are to turn a static site comprising of only HTML and CSS into an interactive site with dynamically created content using JavaScript. Examples of such include a dynamically generated navbar, assigning/removing an "active class" to/from a section depending on which section is in the viewport, and a "scroll-to-anchor" function whereby clicking on the navbar link will automatically scroll to the targeted section. 

Additional dynamic features include; collapsible sections and hiding fixed nav bar when not scrolling.
